<p align="center">A minimalist "retro/hacker" bspwm desktop environment for daily use on archlinux</p>


After configuring a desktop environment with Hyprland on Wayland, I was left wanting to explore something new and different, this time based on Xorg (X11). My goal was to find a minimalist and simple setup that would optimize resources to the maximum without losing that distinct retro-functional and clean aesthetic, I opted for  bspwm.

My configuration aims to be both functional and simple, tailored specifically for my workflow as a Telematics Engineering student and my daily needs.

I hope this repository serve as a guide and inspiration for your 'rice'. If you have any questions or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate you sharing them, either by opening an issue here or contacting me through the methods listed on my GitHub profile.
